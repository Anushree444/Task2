### 1. **Motor Speed Changes but Minimal Change in Serial Output**

**Problem**:  
The motor speed changes as expected with the potentiometer, but the changes are not clearly visible in the Serial Monitor.

**Possible Causes**:

- **Averaging or Noise Reduction**: To reduce fluctuations in the potentiometer readings, multiple readings were averaged. This process can smooth out small changes, making them less noticeable in the Serial Monitor.
  
- **Mapping Issue**: If the potentiometer's range was not mapped correctly (e.g., mapping `0-1023` to `0-255`), the serial output might show less variation than expected, even though the motor speed changes.

### 2. **Limited Visibility of Speed Changes in Serial Output**

**Problem**:  
The Serial Monitor output does not show a wide enough range or difference to observe changes in the motor speed effectively.

**Possible Causes**:

- **Serial Output Frequency**: The serial output may be printed too infrequently, which makes it difficult to observe smaller or rapid changes in speed.

- **Inconsistent Readings**: If the potentiometer readings fluctuate due to noise or averaging, the serial output could appear erratic or show smaller differences than expected.

To address this, it became necessary to determine the actual range of the potentiometer and map it accurately to the motor control range. By reading the raw analog values from the potentiometer and observing the fluctuations, we could ensure that the motor speed control operates within the correct range and responds consistently.

This led to the following improvements:

- Identifying the true range of the potentiometer from **0 to 1023** (instead of **0 to 255**).
- Implementing a stable value mapping from the potentiometer's full range to the motor's speed control.

By determining the potentiometer’s actual range, we were able to improve the reliability of motor control, prevent erratic behavior, and achieve smoother, more predictable motor responses.

### Approach to Determine the Range of the Potentiometer

To determine the range of the potentiometer connected to the analog input pin (**ury**), the following steps were taken:

1. **Read Analog Values**:  
   The potentiometer's analog value was read using the `analogRead()` function, which returns values between **0** and **1023**. This range corresponds to the full range of the potentiometer (from fully left to fully right).

2. **Serial Monitoring**:  
   The potentiometer's readings were printed to the Serial Monitor to observe the values at different positions of the potentiometer:
   
   - At the extreme left (counterclockwise), the potentiometer should produce a reading close to **0**.
   - At the extreme right (clockwise), the potentiometer should produce a reading close to **1023**.

3. **Fluctuations Observed**:  
   Initially, the potentiometer readings fluctuated due to electrical noise and small variations in the analog signal.

### Problem Description: Fluctuating Potentiometer Readings

**Issue**:  
When reading values from the potentiometer connected to the analog input pin **ury**, the output fluctuates unexpectedly even when the potentiometer is in a fixed position. This fluctuation occurs due to noise or small variations in the analog signal from the potentiometer. These fluctuations are common in analog input readings, particularly when the potentiometer is not under a stable load or when there is electrical interference.

**Impact**:  
The readings from the potentiometer are unstable and continuously vary, making it difficult to obtain reliable data for controlling devices (e.g., motor speed or direction). This issue may lead to incorrect behavior in the system, such as erratic motor speeds or unpredictable control outputs.

**Solution**:  
The solution involves **averaging multiple readings** from the potentiometer to smooth out the fluctuations and reduce the noise. 

By taking several readings and calculating their average, the result becomes more stable and reliable, making it easier to interpret the potentiometer's value accurately.
