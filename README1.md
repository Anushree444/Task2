While attempting to control the motor speed and direction using the potentiometer, the initial mapping from the potentiometer values (ranging from 0 to 1023) to motor control values (0 to 255) did not provide the expected results. The motor speed control did not respond as intended, likely due to fluctuating or unstable potentiometer readings.

To address this, it became necessary to determine the actual range of the potentiometer and map it accurately to the motor control range. By reading the raw analog values from the potentiometer and observing the fluctuations, we could ensure that the motor speed control operates within the correct range and responds consistently.

This led to:

Identifying the true range of the potentiometer from 0 to 1023 (instead of 0 to 255).

Implementing a stable value mapping from the potentiometer's full range to the motor's speed control.

By determining the potentiometerâ€™s actual range, we were able to improve the reliability of motor control, prevent erratic behavior, and achieve smoother, more predictable motor responses.

#Approach to Determine the Range of the Potentiometer
To determine the range of the potentiometer connected to the analog input pin (ury), the following steps were taken:

Read Analog Values: The potentiometer's analog value was read using the analogRead() function, which returns values between 0 and 1023. This range corresponds to the full range of the potentiometer (from fully left to fully right).

Serial Monitoring: The potentiometer's readings were printed to the Serial Monitor to observe the values at different positions of the potentiometer:

At the extreme left (counterclockwise), the potentiometer should produce a reading close to 0.

At the extreme right (clockwise), the potentiometer should produce a reading close to 1023.


Fluctuations Observed: Initially, the potentiometer readings fluctuated due to electrical noise and small variations in the analog signal.


#Problem Description: Fluctuating Potentiometer Readings
When reading values from the potentiometer connected to the analog input pin ury, the output fluctuates unexpectedly even when the potentiometer is in a fixed position. This fluctuation occurs due to noise or small variations in the analog signal from the potentiometer. These fluctuations are common in analog input readings, particularly when the potentiometer is not under a stable load or when there is electrical interference.

Impact:
The readings from the potentiometer are unstable and continuously vary, making it difficult to obtain reliable data for controlling devices (e.g., motor speed or direction).

This issue may lead to incorrect behavior in the system, such as erratic motor speeds or unpredictable control outputs.

Solution:
The solution involves averaging multiple readings from the potentiometer to smooth out the fluctuations and reduce the noise.

By taking several readings and calculating their average, the result becomes more stable and reliable, making it easier to interpret the potentiometer's value accurately.
